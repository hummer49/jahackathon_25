# Target Moles

This folder contains target mole images that should NOT fit in with the civilian environments:

## Required Files:
- `businessman_suit.png` - Overdressed businessman (for school level)
- `gang_member.png` - Street thug with tattoos (for hospital level)  
- `surfer_casual.png` - Beach bum in casual wear (for office level)
- `construction_worker.png` - Hard hat construction worker (for restaurant level)

## Image Requirements:
- Format: PNG with transparency support
- Should show people who would obviously NOT belong in civilian environments
- Will be automatically cropped to circular shape
- These are the actual targets players need to identify and hit

**Note: If image files are missing, the game will use red circles as fallbacks and print warning messages.**
